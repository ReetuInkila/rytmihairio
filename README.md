## Tools for identifying arrhythmias from heart rate data.
My goal is to develop a tool with which I can easily monitor heart rate data produced by a sports watch. 
The program's functionalities are/will be:
- Web interface to authenticate the user.
- Automatic search of heartbeat data using polar accesslink api v3.
- Identifying arrhythmias from heart rate data.
- Automatic reporting to the user.

## Future improvements
- improve heart rate data analyzing algorihtms
- turn accesslink functions into one accesslink class
